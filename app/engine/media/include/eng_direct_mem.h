 * direct memory is 12288 MB with an 11 GB contiguous free run, flexible is

 * figure nobody prints is a figure that gets guessed at again.
 *
 * Reports: direct total and largest free run, flexible configured and free,
 * and the engine's own pool. Safe to call before the unjail - a call that fails is
 * reported as -1 rather than skipped, because "the call failed here" is itself
 * the answer to whether this can be measured at that point.
